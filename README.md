Governments are throwing themselves into opening up their data - they just aren't that good at it.

This is an attempt to make some government data more accessible.

I'm Scottish - so I'm looking at Scottish Government at the moment. Happy for volunteers to start opening up their own governments data.

So far the data identified to be open is:

* [Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics Data Zone Lookup](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/sns/SNSRef/DZLookupJan2011)

And implemented so far is:

* nada!
